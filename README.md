# Fractal Plane

Fractal Plane is a repository for generating fractal-based, infinitely scalable plane geometries, allowing users to explore mesmerizing self-similar patterns at multiple scales.

A browser-based tool for creating procedural patterns with basic geometric shapes like triangles and squares. This tool allows users to interactively adjust straight lines into Bézier curves and preview changes live. The generated patterns can be exported as SVG files for further use.

## Status

- unstable


## Features
- **Procedural Generation**: Create patterns using user-defined geometric rules.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Adjust shapes and convert straight lines to Bézier curves with live updates.
- **Live Preview**: See changes in real-time as you modify the shapes.
- **Export to SVG**: Save your generated patterns as SVG files for use in other projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v23.5.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
