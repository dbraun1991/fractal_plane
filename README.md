# Fractal Plane

**Fractal Plane** is a browser-based tool for generating fractal-based, infinitely scalable plane geometries. Users can create self-similar patterns using basic geometric shapes like squares and triangles, with the ability to adjust these shapes interactively into Bézier curves for enhanced creative flexibility. The generated patterns can be exported as SVG files for use in other projects or designs.

## Status

- **Unstable** – Ongoing development and features in progress.

## Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Generate patterns using user-defined geometric rules such as squares and triangles.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Users can switch between square and triangle patterns, and even adjust straight lines into Bézier curves with live previews.
- **Live Preview**: Preview changes in real-time as you modify the shapes, adjust line curvature, and switch between different geometric patterns.
- **Export to SVG**: The generated patterns can be exported as SVG files, allowing users to easily incorporate them into other design projects or applications.
